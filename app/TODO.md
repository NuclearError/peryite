|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 61 | Angular: implement cookie that remembers which css theme is in use
| controller.js | 63 | basic social media metadata - twitter etc, og image/data, use realfavicongenerator for icons
| controller.js | 65 | Angular : figure out how to integrate standalone cool stuff (eg. like the bee game) with the overall website
| controller.js | 67 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example
| controller.js | 69 | Refactor / refine the 'base' colours of the styling: rather than just being a bit grey, load a backup stylesheet so that before a cookie is set and a stylesheet is loaded, there isn't a weird flickering
