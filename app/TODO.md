### FIXMEs
| Filename | line # | FIXME
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 84 | Make it so that when you have a chosen theme, the icon is a circle with a dot (or an empty circle) (Angular ng-class)
| controller.js | 86 | Investigate the lazy-loading issue with the Phaser JS files and the game's preloading process. Ideally Phaser shouldn't even boot until the JS files are lazy-loaded fully.
| controller.js | 88 | Make sure the nav buttons are styled correctly on mobile (including with long names)

### TODOs
| Filename | line # | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 90 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example (double check if this is still needed)
| controller.js | 92 | showcase: use of ReactJS, phaser game, clever API calls, use of JS unit testing if possible?
| controller.js | 94 | Refactor / refine the 'base' colours of the styling: rather than just being a bit grey, load a backup stylesheet so that before a cookie is set and a stylesheet is loaded, there isn't a weird flickering
| controller.js | 96 | implement colour designs from Carly (yay!) - do this once the content and functionality is done
