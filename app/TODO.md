### FIXMEs
| Filename | line # | FIXME
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 84 | Make it so that when you have a chosen theme, the icon is a circle with a dot (or an empty circle) (Angular ng-class)
| controller.js | 86 | Update the head links so that the favicon works correctly (use c9.io source as a reference if needed)
| controller.js | 88 | Investigate the lazy-loading issue with the Phaser JS files and the game's preloading process. Ideally Phaser shouldn't even boot until the JS files are lazy-loaded fully.

### TODOs
| Filename | line # | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 90 | Refactor navigation links to use ng-repeat instead of being manual (if possible)
| controller.js | 92 | basic social media metadata - twitter etc, og image/data, use realfavicongenerator for icons
| controller.js | 94 | Angular : figure out how to integrate standalone cool stuff (eg. like the bee game) with the overall website
| controller.js | 96 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example
| controller.js | 98 | Refactor / refine the 'base' colours of the styling: rather than just being a bit grey, load a backup stylesheet so that before a cookie is set and a stylesheet is loaded, there isn't a weird flickering
| controller.js | 100 | implement colour designs from Carly (yay!)
| controller.js | 102 | showcase: use of ReactJS, phaser game, clever API calls, use of JS unit testing if possible?
