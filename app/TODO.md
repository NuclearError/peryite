### FIXMEs
| Filename | line # | FIXME
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 66 | Cookie code works but you only see the positive view results when you refresh the page. Why is it not dynamically showing/hiding the cookie message?
| controller.js | 68 | Angular: when you switch the theme CSS over using the buttons, the ng-view content disappears. Not good!
| controller.js | 70 | Gulpfile seems to have caught up with the themes so now clicking theme2 does load the new theme colours. However, still weird behaviour going on

### TODOs
| Filename | line # | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 72 | Angular: implement cookie that remembers which css theme is in use
| controller.js | 74 | basic social media metadata - twitter etc, og image/data, use realfavicongenerator for icons
| controller.js | 76 | Angular : figure out how to integrate standalone cool stuff (eg. like the bee game) with the overall website
| controller.js | 78 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example
