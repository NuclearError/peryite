### TODOs
| Filename | line # | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 72 | basic social media metadata - twitter etc, og image/data, use realfavicongenerator for icons
| controller.js | 74 | Angular : figure out how to integrate standalone cool stuff (eg. like the bee game) with the overall website
| controller.js | 76 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example
| controller.js | 78 | Refactor / refine the 'base' colours of the styling: rather than just being a bit grey, load a backup stylesheet so that before a cookie is set and a stylesheet is loaded, there isn't a weird flickering
| controller.js | 80 | creative colours for various themes (leave this til last)
| controller.js | 82 | fix the fontello icons so that the theme buttons are circles, not cogs
