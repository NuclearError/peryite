### TODOs
| Filename | line # | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 84 | Refactor navigation links to use ng-repeat instead of being manual (if possible)
| controller.js | 86 | basic social media metadata - twitter etc, og image/data, use realfavicongenerator for icons
| controller.js | 88 | Angular : figure out how to integrate standalone cool stuff (eg. like the bee game) with the overall website
| controller.js | 90 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example
| controller.js | 92 | Refactor / refine the 'base' colours of the styling: rather than just being a bit grey, load a backup stylesheet so that before a cookie is set and a stylesheet is loaded, there isn't a weird flickering
| controller.js | 94 | implement colour designs from Carly (yay!)
| controller.js | 96 | showcase: use of ReactJS, phaser game, clever API calls, use of JS unit testing if possible?
