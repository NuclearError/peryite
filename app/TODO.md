| Filename | line # | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| controller.js | 75 | basic social media metadata - twitter etc, og image/data, use realfavicongenerator for icons
| controller.js | 77 | Angular : figure out how to integrate standalone cool stuff (eg. like the bee game) with the overall website
| controller.js | 79 | Refactor the config ng-route stuff to be more like the angular-seed example
| controller.js | 81 | Refactor navigation links to use ng-repeat instead of being manual (if possible)
| controller.js | 83 | Refactor / refine the 'base' colours of the styling: rather than just being a bit grey, load a backup stylesheet so that before a cookie is set and a stylesheet is loaded, there isn't a weird flickering
| controller.js | 85 | creative colours for various themes (leave this til last)
| controller.js | 87 | Make it so that when you have a chosen theme, the icon is a circle with a dot (or an empty circle) (Angular ng-class)
