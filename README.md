# Peryite

This project is intended as a showcase website using AngularJS. To run, open the *public/index.html* file over a web server. 

## Website purpose

I needed a personal project that would help me build on my Angular knowledge while also answering questions most frequently
asked by recruiters and tech companies. Sometimes the questions are quite vague and non-technical, like 'Do you know how to 
use APIs' which is an odd question and most easily answered with tangible examples.
